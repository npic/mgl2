All tools in MGL2 are relocateable, standalone Perl 5 scripts. All you need 
to do is to place them in the same directory of your choice.

All tools are depending only on core Perl modules. Any fairly recent unix-like 
systems should not have any problems in running them.

A few tools are of no use if you have non-unix-like system or system without 
X server. The notable examples are gen-desktop, import-desura, and mgl2-x.
