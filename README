=================

A simple, unix way game manager written in Perl. It is the successor to the old

* Much simpler design
* Arbitrary tags
* Getopt::Long for command line parsing
* Documentation

* import-desura: import all games from your Desura installation
* import-mgl1: import all games from your old MGL database
* lookup: lookup database and print filenames of matched games
* mgl2: the main program (interactive)
* mgl2-x: wrap mgl2 to start in a separate X server
