KDE 4 context menu integration

The point of this is to have a handy entry in the Dolphin's context menu to
easily add a game launcher to an MGL2 database.

1. Place the .desktop file into the ~/.kde/share/kde4/services/ServiceMenus/ 
directory;
2. Place the .sh script somewhere;
3. Change the path in the .sh script as you wish;
4. Edit the Exec line in the .desktop file accordingly.
